# ADB File Browser for OSX

An alternative for Android File Transfer.

As many Mac users are aware, [AFT does not always work as expected](https://code.google.com/p/android/issues/detail?id=39548). Since modern Android devices do not support USB mass storage mode, this little application provides an alternative.

At its core, this application just runs `adb` and uses it for directory listings, pushing, and pulling. It does make copying files to and from the device a lot easier, though!

## Installation

[Grab the latest release](https://github.com/jaxbot/ADB-File-Browser-OSX/releases), extract the zip and drag the .app over to your Applications folder (or just run it where it is).

## Feedback

This is all very early, so if you have feedback, ideas, or problems, let me know!
